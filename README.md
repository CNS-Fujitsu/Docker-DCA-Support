This guide is intended to be a point of knowledge for everyone who wants to pass [Docker Certified Associate Exam](https://blog.docker.com/2017/09/introducing-docker-global-professional-certification-program/). The main idea is to provide the right answer/link to every "question" in every domain. Feel free to add useful links below.
